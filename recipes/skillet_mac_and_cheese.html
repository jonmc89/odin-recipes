            <ol class="method_list">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, crumbling with a spoon, until browned and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Add in macaroni, milk, water, and powdered cheese packet and stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is just tender and mixture is thick and creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 cup cheese. Turn off heat. </li>
                <li>Create 4 wells in the macaroni mixture and crack an egg into each well. Sprinkle remaining cheese around eggs; sprinkle evenly with salt. </li>
                <li>Bake skillet in the preheated oven until whites are just set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with pepper and green onions and drizzle with hot sauce.</li>
